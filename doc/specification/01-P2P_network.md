## P2P network

Each OWS *project* has its own P2P network of private servers.

Currently only **Linux x86-64** servers are supported.

Projects are unlikely to need more than 100 servers, and nodes are non-adverserial, so the nodes can syncronize their state using message [flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_algorithm).

### Bootstrapping

The first server of a project is called the *bootstrap server*, and must be configured manually.

Manual server configuration consists of the following steps (as root user):
   1. Set environment variable `OWS_PRIVATE_KEY` to the server's Ed25519 private key (base64 encoded)
   2. Set environment variable `OWS_INITIAL_CONFIG` to the initial project configuration (base64 encoded)
   3. Install the node
   4. Start the node

The initial project configuration can be generated by the client.

The node will automatically create an `/etc/init.d/ows` script if it doesn't already exist [].

### Adding servers

Once compute providers have been configured, additional servers can be added to the P2P network automatically [].
